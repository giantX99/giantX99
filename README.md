- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Gian Lucca or @giantX99
-  Iâ€™m interested in gaining more exposure in robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence fields.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning robotics, machine learning modeling for classification and object detection as well as object tracking. Some of the work that I've published here contains class and research projects such as a Camera GUI, scripts to control the Intel RealSense Stereo cameras, data management and processing for custom datasets, as well as custom trained object detection models like YOLOv7 and MobileNet.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Robotics projects as well as machine learning projects.
- ðŸ“« Hit me up on LinkedIn or through my email and lets talk about robotics and how it's so important to learn it today's world!! (www.linkedin.com/in/gian-lucca-teixeira/) (gat7hb@missouri.edu)
